# The history of Googlecode Project (android-apktool)

brut.alll started the Googlecode project for Apktool in January of 2010, with the first release being published on Googlecode
in March of 2010. Googlecode became the home for Apktool from then until March 2015 when Googlecode [announced](https://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html)
a shutdown of the service.  

After already [losing](https://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html) the ability to upload files years ago,
it was obvious Googlecode was loosing to popular alternatives such as Github and Bitbucket.  

Since Apktool [already](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool) had a mirror of GIT at Github, we choose to move there.
